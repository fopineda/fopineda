I also have background in IT and currently I am an Offensive Cyberspace Officer for the United States Air Force. My passion lies in coding but occasionally I dabble in Cybersecurity. I recently received my Security+ certification, which helps understand a lot of the defense and security concepts that take place in organizations/companies.
